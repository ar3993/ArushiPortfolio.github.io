								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>The Risk Register in the State of Natural Capital Report identifies gas power generation as a significant source of NO2 and PM emissions in the UK. Although the share of renewables is increasing in the energy mix, gas is still the most secure source of energy and will be so in the foreseeable future. 
								    To restrict air pollution emissions coming from power generation accurate forecasting of gas power production is very important to ensure that gas power plants are only used when necessary which can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve grid reliability, and reduce costs. </p>		 	                            
								<p> In this project, two methods for time series forecasting will be deployed.</p>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from The Modo Energy Platform containing 'Energy Generation by Fuel type'
								<ul>
                                    <li>It was the half-hourly data collected for 1 year, from the 24th of June 2022 to the 25th of June 2023.</li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format, in sets of two week time period(due to a download limit). </li>
									<li>This data was cleaned in excel by firstly, removing unnecessary columns aside from CCGT and OCGT data, summing both the CCGT and OCGT column for arriving at the total gas generation, and secondly, removing half-hourly time stamps, retaining only hourly time stamps and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>

								<h2>Data Pre-Processing (Python)</h2>
								<p>After loading the data into Python, the data was pre processed for the analysis and features were created on time variables as well as statistical variables. 
								<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
								<p>Feature engineering in time series data requires capturing temporal patterns and dependancies that can affect the target variable.
								<p>Here we create the features like date, hour, day of week, day of month, day of year, season, month, year, lags, rolling means and differntial which can explain the trends of gas power generation data.
								</p>	
								<p>The code for the entire model building and validation is compiled in a 'class' function for increasing scalability, resusability and consistency.</p>

								<p> RESULTS:
								<p>We can visualise some interesting relationships between gas energy generation across different temporal patterns in our dataset of June 2022 - June 2023 as follows:

								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Feature Importance</b></p>
								<p>Features play a significant role in predicting or explaining the variations in gas power generation. In our data we can see the following features as the most important:
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/feat_imp.png" alt="" width="850" height="500"/></span>
                                <p> </p>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Lag 1:</b>It is the value of Gas(MWs) exactly one time step (in this case an hour prior) before the current timestamp. Electricity generation often follows short-term temporal dependencies. If demand or generation was high yesterday or in the previous hour, it’s very likely to be similar now — due to regular consumption patterns and grid inertia. Power generation usually doesn’t fluctuate wildly in the short term unless there’s a shock.</li>
                                   					 <li> <b>Rolling Mean 3:</b> It is the average of the past 3 values of Gas(MWs) (excluding current time). It smooths out short-term fluctuations, helping the model see underlying patterns instead of noise. It helps mitigate the impact of anomalies, outliers, or sudden fluctuations that might mislead the model. Rolling averages help in capturing underlying cycles or short-term demand patterns.</li>
									<li> <b>Lag 2:</b> It is the value of Gas(MWs) two time steps (in this case an hour prior) before the current timestamp. It adds momentum awareness: looking at both Lag 1 and Lag 2 helps the model detect trends vs. reversals. It is useful for deriving acceleration/deceleration in gas generation (e.g., rate of change).</li>

								<h2>Running the regression using LSTM</h2>
                                <p> For the task of time series forecasting of power generated by Gas for the period of 25th June 23' from the training dataset of hourly energy generated by gas from the period of 24th Jun 22' to 24th Jun 23', LSTM is used with number of inputs as 24, number of features as 1. We define a Sequential model with a 'relu' activation function and run it over 15 epochs (which was found to be the most optimal).</p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Comparing the RMSEs, LSTM was a more accurate predictor for gas production for a one-day hourly period, but with this data for hourly frequency, it was unable to accurately predict a longer period of 2 weeks.</li>
                                    <li>XGBoost had a higher RMSE, but did a better job at predicting a longer period of forecast.</li>
									<li>We understood that the three most important features affecting gas production are: 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Day of the yeek:</b> Since gas often plays a role in balancing the grid, this feature reflects issues like the fluctuating supply of renewables, weather conditions, gas pricing and maintenance scheduling.</li>
										    <li><b>Hour:</b> In the UK, on average, the highest gas power generation occurs in the evening between 6 to 8 PM while the lowest occurs early in the morning, around 4 am.</li>
										    <li><b>Day of week:</b> Power from gas generation is on average, higher on weekdays than on weekends with Thursday being the highest and Sunday being the lowest.</li>
										</ul>
