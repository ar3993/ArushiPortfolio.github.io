								<p>By linking work demand to rural population and irrigation access, this project explores structural factors influencing public employment reliance. </p>		 	                            
								<p>This project is put forth to provide an in-depth data driven economic analysis on the key trends and insights coming out of the demand for the MGNREGA scheme in the rural population of Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>	
								<p>Tools used in the assignment primarily consist of MS Excel and Python.</p>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The data used in the analysis is credited to the MGNREGA website, 2011 Population Census and Irrigation Census for the data for irrigation facilities.  </p>
								<p>Data cleaning has been done to account for discrepancies between the change of districts within Madhya Pradesh between 2011 to 2023. The values for the districts of AGAR-MALWA and Niwari have been merged with the values of the districts Shajapur and Tikamgarh respectively. The district Narmadapuram has been changed to Hoshangabad to account for a renaming of the district.</p>

								<h2>Plotting the number of households that demanded work
during each month for the entire state as well as the top 5 districts with the highest amount of
work demanded during the year.</h2>
								<p>The describe() function in Python (using pandas) provides a quick statistical summary of numerical columns in a DataFrame. For each column, it outputs key metrics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50%), 75th percentile, and maximum.
								This is great for a quick overview into the scale of each fuel, detecting anomalies and comparing fuel types.</p>

								<p>For clearer visualisation, I’ve plotted a dual axis chart below. This provides a compact view of the trends of demand for work across the year for the top 5 districts and the state.</p>

								<p>The following trends can be observed from the produced charts:
</p>
						
								<ul>
									<li> <b>1) Top districts heavily influence overall state trends:</b>
The peaks and troughs of the demand for work by the total population of Madhya Pradesh coincides heavily with 4 out of the 5 top-demanding districts for work (except Morena). This suggests that these few districts are major drivers of the overall trend. In statistical terms, they likely contribute disproportionately to total work demand, so their variations shift the whole curve.</li>
                                                                        <li> <b>Common seasonal or structural patterns across districts:</b>
The synchronized timing of demand (e.g., peak in May–June, dip in April and November) likely reflects seasonal agricultural cycles, climate, or policy-driven work schedules that affect many districts similarly. This suggests statewide homogeneity in how and when people seek work under MGNREGA (or a similar scheme).</li>
									
                                </ul>
								<p>MGNREGA work demand is closely tied to agricultural off-season. High demand can be explained in May-June which is the time period Just before sowing or after harvest — people are free and need work. While low demand in August is due to peak farming periods (like monsoon sowing), when most are occupied. Extreme summer months (April–June) may see high demand due to lack of alternative employment and prep work for kharif season. While winter months (Dec–Jan) may see low demand due to weather conditions or festivals.</p>
                                				<p>Fund release cycles also affect the work under MGNREGA. Sometimes MGNREGA funds are disbursed in certain quarters, leading to artificially high demand in those periods when work is made available.
These top 5 districts could be large, rural, and demographically representative, so their seasonal labor patterns closely mirror the entire state’s. </p>
                              					<p>The district of Morena doesn't match the state pattern and remained steady throughout the year, without huge peaks or troughs, which could signal different local economic dynamics (e.g., urbanization, alternate employment) or a unique implementation pattern of government schemes.</p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<p> We can observe the following conclusions from our initial exploratory data analysis: </p>
										<ul>
										    <li><b>Correlation:</b> The correlation matrix revealed structural energy transitions in the US:

											From coal and petroleum towards natural gas, wind, and solar.</li>
										    <li><b>Volatility:</b> The coefficient of variance (CV) was used to understand fuel volatility. Solar and Wind are highly variable both because of resource intermittency and rapid capacity expansion; they need complementary flexibility sources (gas, storage). While Coal and Gas exhibit similar CVs (~33 %) but for opposite reasons gas is ramping up, coal winding down—masking very different structural trends. These insights on fuel volatilities help operators and policymakers balance the U.S. energy mix — pairing low‑volatility baseload with high‑volatility renewables and planning storage investments accordingly.


									<li><b> Year-over-Year(YoY) Growth:</b> The data clearly shows a clean energy transition in the U.S., with solar and wind leading the way. Natural gas plays a stabilizing role, while coal and petroleum are in structural decline. Slow-growing sources like nuclear and hydro highlight infrastructure or policy bottlenecks. These trends have major implications for climate goals, energy security, and investment priorities.
