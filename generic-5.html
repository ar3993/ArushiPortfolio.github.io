								<p>The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is one of the world’s largest public works programs, designed to reduce rural poverty, create durable assets, and empower marginalized communities through demand-driven wage employment. By linking work demand to rural population and irrigation access, this project explores structural factors influencing public employment reliance. </p>		 	                            
								<p>This project is put forth to provide an in-depth data driven economic analysis on the key trends and insights coming out of the demand for the MGNREGA scheme in the rural population of Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>	
								<p>Tools used in the assignment primarily consist of MS Excel and Python.</p>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The data used in the analysis is credited to the MGNREGA website, 2011 Population Census and Irrigation Census for the data for irrigation facilities.  </p>
								<p>Data cleaning has been done to account for discrepancies between the change of districts within Madhya Pradesh between 2011 to 2023. The values for the districts of AGAR-MALWA and Niwari have been merged with the values of the districts Shajapur and Tikamgarh respectively. The district Narmadapuram has been changed to Hoshangabad to account for a renaming of the district.</p>

								<p>For clearer visualisation, I’ve plotted a dual axis chart below. This provides a compact view of the trends of demand for work across the year for the top 5 districts and the state.</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/Screenshot 2025-07-07 004538.png" alt="" /></span>
								
							
								<p>The following trends can be observed from the produced charts:
</p>
						
								<ul>
									<li> <b>1) Top districts heavily influence overall state trends:</b>
The peaks and troughs of the demand for work by the total population of Madhya Pradesh coincides heavily with 4 out of the 5 top-demanding districts for work (except Morena). This suggests that these few districts are major drivers of the overall trend. In statistical terms, they likely contribute disproportionately to total work demand, so their variations shift the whole curve.</li>
                                                                        <li> <b>Common seasonal or structural patterns across districts:</b>
The synchronized timing of demand (e.g., peak in May–June, dip in April and November) likely reflects seasonal agricultural cycles, climate, or policy-driven work schedules that affect many districts similarly. This suggests statewide homogeneity in how and when people seek work under MGNREGA (or a similar scheme).</li>
									
                                </ul>
								<p>MGNREGA work demand is closely tied to agricultural off-season. High demand can be explained in May-June which is the time period Just before sowing or after harvest — people are free and need work. While low demand in August is due to peak farming periods (like monsoon sowing), when most are occupied. Extreme summer months (April–June) may see high demand due to lack of alternative employment and prep work for kharif season. While winter months (Dec–Jan) may see low demand due to weather conditions or festivals.</p>
                                				<p>Fund release cycles also affect the work under MGNREGA. Sometimes MGNREGA funds are disbursed in certain quarters, leading to artificially high demand in those periods when work is made available.
These top 5 districts could be large, rural, and demographically representative, so their seasonal labor patterns closely mirror the entire state’s. </p>
                              					<p>The district of Morena doesn't match the state pattern and remained steady throughout the year, without huge peaks or troughs, which could signal different local economic dynamics (e.g., urbanization, alternate employment) or a unique implementation pattern of government schemes.</p>
