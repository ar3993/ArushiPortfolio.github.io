								<p>This project analyzes shifts in the U.S. electricity generation mix from 2000 to 2024 using statistical analysis and visualizations. It integrates insights on major federal and state-level energy policies to evaluate their impact on fuel share, volatility, and renewable adoption. </p>		 	                            
								<p>For the dataset on U.S. energy generation by fuel type from 2001 to 2024, EDA helps uncover:</p>	
									<table border="1">

											<td> Trends Over Time: Visualizing changes in fuel usage (e.g., decline of coal, rise of renewables) highlights how U.S. energy policy, technology, and demand have evolved.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Comparative Insights: EDA enables comparisons across fuel types, helping identify dominant sources (like natural gas) and emerging contributors (like solar and wind).</td>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/tools/)
								<ul>
                                    <li>Annual energy generated from different fuel types has been captured across the years 2000-2024. The units are in Gigawatt-hours (GWh) </li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format directly from the site.</li>
									<li>This data was cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>

                                <p></p>
								<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
								<p>The describe() function in Python (using pandas) provides a quick statistical summary of numerical columns in a DataFrame. For each column, it outputs key metrics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50%), 75th percentile, and maximum.
								This is great for a quick overview into the scale of each fuel, detecting anomalies and comparing fuel types.</p>

								<span class="image"><img src="images/fuel-gen-line-chart.png" alt="" width="1300" height="620" /></span>
								<li>The sharp decline in coal post-2008 aligns with both stricter EPA emissions regulations and the natural gas boom, highlighting regulatory and market interplay.</li>
								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Correlation Heatmaps</b></p>
								<p> Correlation quickly reveals which fuel types rise or fall together (e.g., wind + gas) and which move in opposite directions (e.g., coal vs. solar). This helps analysts understand substitution vs. complementarity in the grid. A heat‑map offers an instant visual cue — a quicker glance where relationships are strongest or weakest without wading through tables of numbers.

								<ul>
									<li> Renewables Rise, Fossils Fall: Clear trend of negative correlation between fossil fuels and renewables (Coal–Wind: -0.9816), (Coal–Natural Gas: -0.9759) (Coal–Solar: ~-0.90) suggests a long-term shift in U.S. energy policy or infrastructure investment.</li>
                                                                        <li> Complementarity Within Clean Energy sources: Strong positive correlations among renewables (Wind-Natural Gas: 0.9799) and (Geothermal-Natural Gas: 0.8649) imply coordinated growth and push for cleaner energy sources.</li>
									<li> Solar's growing importance in the energy mix: A correlation of 0.7553 with 'All fuels' implies that solar's contribution to total energy is both substantial and growing consistently over the years. It’s not the dominant source, but its trend aligns with total growth. </li>
									<p> Overall these trends are useful for forecasting future energy generation mix in the US.</p>
                                </ul>
								<p><b>Most and least volatile fuels</b></p>
                                <p> The “most” and “least” volatile fuel statistics indicates which fuels swing wildly and which are steady. This lets planners blend assets to reduce overall grid stability, investment risk, and operational flexibility—key ingredients for an optimized, resilient energy mix. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a powerful metric for comparing relative variability across fuels—especially when their average generation levels differ drastically.</p>
                                <span class="image"><img src="images/mos-least-volatile.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p> The coefficent of variance for Hydro‑electric pumped storage being -19.91 is a special case. The fuel has a negative mean (net energy consumption) thus yields a negative CV. Pumped storage is an energy‑storage technology, not a net generator. Inference from the rest of the output is described in the following table. </p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<p> We can observe the following conclusions from our initial exploratory data analysis: </p>
										<ul>
										    <li><b>Correlation:</b> The correlation matrix revealed structural energy transitions in the US:

											From coal and petroleum towards natural gas, wind, and solar.</li>
										    <li><b>Volatility:</b> The coefficient of variance (CV) was used to understand fuel volatility. Solar and Wind are highly variable both because of resource intermittency and rapid capacity expansion; they need complementary flexibility sources (gas, storage). While Coal and Gas exhibit similar CVs (~33 %) but for opposite reasons gas is ramping up, coal winding down—masking very different structural trends. These insights on fuel volatilities help operators and policymakers balance the U.S. energy mix — pairing low‑volatility baseload with high‑volatility renewables and planning storage investments accordingly.


									<li><b> Year-over-Year(YoY) Growth:</b> The data clearly shows a clean energy transition in the U.S., with solar and wind leading the way. Natural gas plays a stabilizing role, while coal and petroleum are in structural decline. Slow-growing sources like nuclear and hydro highlight infrastructure or policy bottlenecks. These trends have major implications for climate goals, energy security, and investment priorities.
