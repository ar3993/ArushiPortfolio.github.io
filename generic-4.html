								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and interpreting large datasets, especially in the energy sector. </p>		 	                            
								<p> For the dataset on U.S. energy generation by fuel type from 2001 to 2024, EDA helps uncover:</p>	
									<table border="1">
										<tr>
											<td> Trends Over Time: Visualizing changes in fuel usage (e.g., decline of coal, rise of renewables) highlights how U.S. energy policy, technology, and demand have evolved.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Comparative Insights: EDA enables comparisons across fuel types, helping identify dominant sources (like natural gas) and emerging contributors (like solar and wind).</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Correlation Analysis: Understanding relationships between variables (e.g., solar vs. total generation) supports better modeling and forecasting.</td>
										</tr>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/tools/)
								<ul>
                                    <li>Annual energy generated from different fuel types has been captured across the years 2000-2024. The units are in Gigawatt-hours (GWh) </li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format directly from the site.</li>
									<li>This data was cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>

                                <p></p>
								<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
								<p>The describe() function in Python (using pandas) provides a quick statistical summary of numerical columns in a DataFrame. For each column, it outputs key metrics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50%), 75th percentile, and maximum.
								This is great for a quick overview into the scale of each fuel, detecting anomalies and comparing fuel types.</p>

								<p> <b>Correlation Heatmaps</b></p>
								<p>	Features play a significant role in predicting or explaining the variations in Brent oil prices. In our data we can see the following features and trends as the most important:

								<ul>
									<li> <b>Lag 1: </b>The feature importance of this variable suggests that the Brent oil prices are very closely related to yesterday's prices. Oil prices may continue in the same direction for several days due to: Investor sentiment, News cycles, Supply chain or geopolitical events. Lag-1 captures this inertia.</li>
                                                                        <li> <b>7 day rolling mean:</b> The 7-day mean filters out the noise that comes from sudden news events, speculative trading and shirt-term market overreaction. It presents a cleaner signal, which the model finds useful. The feature importance of a 7 day rolling means you’re forecasting in a system where short-term trends are stable, and momentum plays a big role.</li>
									<li> <b> Year:</b> We can see that the Brent crude oil reached its all-time nominal high of $147.27 per barrel in July 2008. This historic peak was driven by a combination of - sky‑high global demand, especially from emerging economies in China and India, coupled with constrained supply, a weak U.S. dollar and intense speculative investment in oil futures markets, geopolitical disruptions (e.g., tensions in the Middle East, attacks, and pipeline threats) and broader fear of peak oil. While the Brent oil hit the lowest price during the March 2020 oil price crash, amid the COVID‑19 pandemic and a supply war </li>
                                </ul>
								<p>Most and least volatile fuels</p>
                                <p> For the task of time series forecasting of Brent oil price for the period of 1st January 24' to 18th November 24' from the training dataset of daily Brent spot price from 1987 to 2023, XGBoost is used with a learning rate of 0.01 (which was found to be the most optimal for longer time series in order to avoid overfitting).</p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>We understood that the two most important features affecting gas production are: 
										<ul>
										    <li><b>1 Day Lag:</b> Brent oil prices often exhibit strong autocorrelation — meaning today's price is highly related to yesterday's. The 1 day lag feature captures this short term inertia. In economic or commodity time series, yesterday’s price is often the strongest predictor of today’s price.</li>
										    <li><b>7 day rolling mean:</b> The 7-day rolling mean smooths out short-term fluctuations and reflects the underlying trend. A 7-day window implicitly captures weekly seasonality (e.g., changes in trading behavior or economic data releases). It helps the model see the broader context around recent price changes.</li>
										</ul>	
									<li>Recursive forecasting based on the above two features has produced a relatively accurate forecast of future Brent Oil prices beyond the test dataset and can be used in analysis and decision making with confidence.
										</li>
