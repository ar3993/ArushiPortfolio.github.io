								<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and interpreting large datasets, especially in the energy sector. </p>		 	                            
								<p> For the dataset on U.S. energy generation by fuel type from 2001 to 2024, EDA helps uncover:</p>	
									<table border="1">
										<tr>
											<td> Trends Over Time: Visualizing changes in fuel usage (e.g., decline of coal, rise of renewables) highlights how U.S. energy policy, technology, and demand have evolved.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Comparative Insights: EDA enables comparisons across fuel types, helping identify dominant sources (like natural gas) and emerging contributors (like solar and wind).</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Correlation Analysis: Understanding relationships between variables (e.g., solar vs. total generation) supports better modeling and forecasting.</td>
										</tr>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/tools/)
								<ul>
                                    <li>Annual energy generated from different fuel types has been captured across the years 2000-2024. The units are in Gigawatt-hours (GWh) </li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format directly from the site.</li>
									<li>This data was cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>

                                <p></p>
								<p>Cleaned data:</p>

                                <p></p>
								<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
								<p>The describe() function in Python (using pandas) provides a quick statistical summary of numerical columns in a DataFrame. For each column, it outputs key metrics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50%), 75th percentile, and maximum.
								This is great for a quick overview into the scale of each fuel, detecting anomalies and comparing fuel types.</p>

								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Correlation Heatmaps</b></p>
								<p> Correlation quickly reveals which fuel types rise or fall together (e.g., wind + gas) and which move in opposite directions (e.g., coal vs. solar). This helps analysts understand substitution vs. complementarity in the grid. A heat‑map offers an instant visual cue — a quicker glance where relationships are strongest or weakest without wading through tables of numbers.

								<ul>
									<li> Renewables Rise, Fossils Fall: Clear trend of negative correlation between fossil fuels and renewables (Coal–Wind: -0.9816), (Coal–Natural Gas: -0.9759) (Coal–Solar: ~-0.90) suggests a long-term shift in U.S. energy policy or infrastructure investment.</li>
                                                                        <li> Complementarity Within Clean Energy sources: Strong positive correlations among renewables (Wind-Natural Gas: 0.9799) and (Geothermal-Natural Gas: 0.8649) imply coordinated growth and push for cleaner energy sources.</li>
									<li> Solar's growing importance in the energy mix: A correlation of 0.7553 with 'All fuels' implies that solar's contribution to total energy is both substantial and growing consistently over the years. It’s not the dominant source, but its trend aligns with total growth. </li>
									<p> Overall these trends are useful for forecasting future energy generation mix in the US.</p>
                                </ul>
								<p><b>Most and least volatile fuels</b></p>
                                <p> The “most” and “least” volatile fuel statistics indicates which fuels swing wildly and which are steady. This lets planners blend assets to reduce overall grid stability, investment risk, and operational flexibility—key ingredients for an optimized, resilient energy mix. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a powerful metric for comparing relative variability across fuels—especially when their average generation levels differ drastically.</p>

										        <td> Solar’s high CV reflects its rapid capacity build‑out plus inherent day‑to‑day variability; wind shows similar behaviour. Petroleum liquids are used mainly for peaking or emergencies, so volumes spike irregularly. • Requires flexible backup (gas turbines, storage) and robust forecasting.</td>

										             <li>• Nuclear 1.8 % </li> 
											</td>
										        <td> Output stays close to long‑term mean. Nuclear is the steadiest baseload; geothermal and hydro provide predictable generation with seasonal patterns.</td>

								<ul>
									<li> : 
										<ul>
										    <li><b>Correlation:</b> The correlation matrix revealed structural energy transitions in the US:

											From coal and petroleum towards natural gas, wind, and solar.</li>
										    <li>7 day rolling mean:</b> The 7-day rolling mean smooths out short-term fluctuations and reflects the underlying trend. A 7-day window implicitly captures weekly seasonality (e.g., changes in trading behavior or economic data releases). It helps the model see the broader context around recent price changes.</li>
										</ul>	
									<li>Recursive forecasting based on the above two features has produced a relatively accurate forecast of future Brent Oil prices beyond the test dataset and can be used in analysis and decision making with confidence
										</li>
