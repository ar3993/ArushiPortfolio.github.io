								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p> This project aims to create an interactive and informative geospatial visualization of natural gas and oil pipelines across Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean region. The goal is to better understand the region’s energy infrastructure, key transit routes, and geopolitical relevance using Python-based mapping libraries. </p>

								<h3> TurkStream Pipeline</h3>
								<p>The TurkStream pipeline is a natural gas pipeline that transports Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey. It begins in Anapa, Russia, and ends in Kıyıköy, Turkey, with one line supplying Turkey and a second extending toward southern Europe. </p>	
                                                                <p>We use the geolocator function to get the coordinates of both the source and destination </p>

								<li>1. In May 2017, the construction of the TurkStream gas pipeline started, in the Black Sea near the Russian Coast</li>
								<li>2. January 2020 saw the start of the gas supplies via the TurkStream</li>
								<li>3. It consists of two 930 km long offshore pipelines from Anapa in Russia to Kiyikov in Turkey. And the total cost is around EUR 11.4 billion</li>
								<li>4. It allows 31.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year</li>
								<li>5. It enhances the security of energy supplies from Turkey and from there to Europe</li>
                                <p></p>
								<p></p>
								<h3>EastMed Pipeline</h3>
								<p>The EastMed pipeline is a proposed 1,900 km natural gas pipeline intended to transport gas from offshore fields in the Eastern Mediterranean near Israel and Cyprus to mainland Greece via Crete, and eventually to Italy and Europe. It aims to enhance European energy security by diversifying supply routes away from Russian gas.</p>

								<h3> Belt and Road Initiative </h3>
								<p>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive global infrastructure and investment program launched by China in 2013 by President Xi Jinping. Its core aims are to enhance connectivity, trade, and cooperation across Asia, Africa, Europe, and beyond through expansive networks of land and maritime routes—reviving the historic Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road trade paths.</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/bri_1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="720"/></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/bri_2.png" alt="" width="1200" height="320"/></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/bri_3.png" alt="" width="1200" height="100"/></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/BRI.png" alt="" width="1200" height="760"/></span>

								<p> The BRI involves investments in approximately 70 countries and international organisations connecting two ends of Eurasia along with stops in Africa and Oceania to create a unified large market, an economic development zone. The connection will be made with both a maritime route across the sea and an overland route. The goal is to complete the entire project in around 2050. </p>
								<p> Geopolitical Implications: </p>
								<li> China will provide aid to all the countries in this route in order to build the necessary infrastructure which include railways, roads, ports, energy systems and telecommunication networks.
								<li> China will purchase mines for genwration of energy and laying down transmission networks.
								<li> Chinese enterprises will operate across all the cities and locations. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will play a significant role in this. 
								<li> This is intended to propel the currency of China, Renminbi, to become the main investment currency in all the countries involved. China will also purchase 
								<li> It will also involve cultural exchanges and integration to bring the nations closer and make them familiar with each other's culture, increase mutual understanding and peace. This will extend Chinese economic and political influence.
                                <li> Countries that have been positive about this: Malaysia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Kyrgystan
Vietnam and India have expressed doubts about this and have been generally negative </li>
