								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>Industries such as aviation, shipping, chemicals, and manufacturing are highly sensitive to oil prices. Forecasting helps them plan procurement and stabilize operating costs. Oil forecasts are also utilised by investors, hedge funds, and trading firms to manage risk, optimize portfolios, and inform long/short strategies in commodities, energy, and related sectors.
								   Accurate forecasts help governments and central banks make informed fiscal and monetary decisions. Thus, this project will attempt to use machine learning methods to forecast Brent Oil, which serves as the primary benchmark for oil pricing worldwide. </p>		 	                            
								<p> In this project, two methods for time series forecasting will be deployed.</p>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/tools/)
								<ul>
                                    <li>Daily Brent oil prices data was collected for 37 years, from May 1987 to the November of 2024.</li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format directly from the site.</li>
									<li>This data was cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>	
									
								<p>Raw extracted data:</p>

                                <p></p>

                                <p></p>
								<h2>Data Pre-Processing (Python)</h2>
								<p>After loading the data into Python, the data was pre processed for the analysis by converting the timestamp column to datetime format, as well as setting the column as index.</p>

								<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
								<p>Feature engineering in time series data requires capturing temporal patterns and dependancies that can affect the target variable.
								<p>Here we will create the features like day, month, year, day of year, week of year, incorporating a 1-day lag to capture short-term momentum, and adding a 7-day rolling mean to smooth out weekly trends and highlight underlying patterns.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/features-brent-oil.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> We can visualise some interesting relationships between Brent Oil price across different temporal patterns in our dataset as follows:

								<span class="image"><img src="images/7-day-rolling-mean.png" alt="" width="920" height="450"/></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/brent-1daylag.png" alt="" width="920" height="450"/></span>
								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Feature Importance</b></p>
								<p>	Features play a significant role in predicting or explaining the variations in Brent oil prices. In our data we can see the following features and trends as the most important:
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/feature-importance-code.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/feature-importance.png" alt="" width="620" height="400"/></span>
                                <p> </p>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Lag 1: </b>The feature importance of this variable suggests that the Brent oil prices are very closely related to yesterday's prices. Oil prices may continue in the same direction for several days due to: Investor sentiment, News cycles, Supply chain or geopolitical events. Lag-1 captures this inertia.</li>
                                                                        <li> <b>7 day rolling mean:</b> The 7-day mean filters out the noise that comes from sudden news events, speculative trading and shirt-term market overreaction. It presents a cleaner signal, which the model finds useful. The feature importance of a 7 day rolling means you’re forecasting in a system where short-term trends are stable, and momentum plays a big role.</li>
									<li> <b> Year:</b> We can see that the Brent crude oil reached its all-time nominal high of $147.27 per barrel in July 2008. This historic peak was driven by a combination of - sky‑high global demand, especially from emerging economies in China and India, coupled with constrained supply, a weak U.S. dollar and intense speculative investment in oil futures markets, geopolitical disruptions (e.g., tensions in the Middle East, attacks, and pipeline threats) and broader fear of peak oil. While the Brent oil hit the lowest price during the March 2020 oil price crash, amid the COVID‑19 pandemic and a supply war </li>
                                </ul>
								<h2>Running the regression using XGBoost</h2>
                                <p> For the task of time series forecasting of Brent oil price for the period of 1st January 24' to 18th November 24' from the training dataset of daily Brent spot price from 1987 to 2023, XGBoost is used with a learning rate of 0.01 (which was found to be the most optimal for longer time series in order to avoid overfitting).</p>
                                <span class="image"><img src="images/running-model.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>Forecasting on the dataset</b></p>

								<p></p>
                                <p>Calculating the RMSE to the note accuracy of the model </p>
                                <span class="image"><img src="images/rmse.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>1.46 error on price that typically fluctuates between 60 and 90 USD is reasonably well - roughly 5% relative RMSE, which is solid for financial time series. Suggesting the model is capturing the general pattern reasonably well, without overfitting. </p>
                                <p></p>
								<h2>Deploying the model to forecast future prices beyond the test set</h2>
                                <p> For the task of forecasting Brent Oil prices beyond the dataset we'll use recursive forecasting methods. The prices will be predicted for a period of 25th June 23' from the training dataset of hourly energy generated by gas from the period of 19th Nov 24' to 28th Nov 24'. We will only use the two most important features, namely 1 day lag and the 7 day rolling mean to train the model and do recursive forecasting</p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Looking at the error patterns between the predicted and actual values, the model is flattening out the volatility. Some strategies to improve could be adding a 3 day/ 7 day lag, Differencing: Create features like diff_1 = price - lag_1, oil related indicators like - Crude oil inventories (EIA), OPEC production quotas, USD Index (DXY), geopolitical news sentiment scores.
Recursive forecasting (feeding back predictions) also causes error accumulation. We can use direct multi-step models - training separate models to predict t+1, t+2, ..., t+10 or use multi-output regressors (e.g. MultiOutputRegressor(XGBRegressor()))</li>
									<li>We understood that the three most important features affecting gas production are: 
										<ul>
										    <li><b>1 Day Lag:</b> Brent oil prices often exhibit strong autocorrelation — meaning today's price is highly related to yesterday's. The 1 day lag feature captures this short term inertia. In economic or commodity time series, yesterday’s price is often the strongest predictor of today’s price.</li>
										    <li><b>7 day rolling mean:</b> The 7-day rolling mean smooths out short-term fluctuations and reflects the underlying trend. A 7-day window implicitly captures weekly seasonality (e.g., changes in trading behavior or economic data releases). It helps the model see the broader context around recent price changes.</li>
										</ul>
