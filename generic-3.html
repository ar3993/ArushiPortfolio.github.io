								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>Industries such as aviation, shipping, chemicals, and manufacturing are highly sensitive to oil prices. Forecasting helps them plan procurement and stabilize operating costs. Oil forecasts are also utilised by investors, hedge funds, and trading firms to manage risk, optimize portfolios, and inform long/short strategies in commodities, energy, and related sectors.
								   Accurate forecasts help governments and central banks make informed fiscal and monetary decisions. Thus, this project will attempt to use machine learning methods to forecast Brent Oil, which serves as the primary benchmark for oil pricing worldwide. </p>		 	                            
								<p> In this project, two methods for time series forecasting will be deployed.</p>

											<td> A popular machine learning algorithm which learns complex patterns and interactions in the data while maintaining good generalization performance. It combines multiple weak models to create a strong and accurate predictive model which makes it efficient in time series forecasting.</td>

								<h2>Data Extraction & Transformation (Excel)</h2>
								<p> The dataset used here is from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/tools/)
								<ul>
                                    <li>It was the daily prices data collected for 37 years, from May 1987 to the November of 2024.</li>
									<li>These were extracted in the CSV format directly from the site.</li>
									<li>This data was cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and renaming the columns for the purpose simplifying this analysis.</li>
								</ul>	
                                </p>
									
								<p>Below are the raw and transformed excel data.</p>	
									
								<p>Raw extracted data:</p>
								
								<span class="image"><img src="images/raw-data.png" alt="" width="500" height="450" /></span>
                                <p></p>
								<p>Cleaned data:</p>
                                <p></p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/oil-price-dataframe.png" alt="" width="750" height="500"/></span>
                                <p></p>
								<h2>Data Pre-Processing (Python)</h2>
								<p>After loading the data into Python, the data was pre processed for the analysis by converting the timestamp column to datetime format, as well as setting the column as index.</p>
								<p></p>

								<p></p>
								<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
								<p>Feature engineering in time series data requires capturing temporal patterns and dependancies that can affect the target variable.
								<p>Here we will create the features like day, month, year, day of year, week of year, incorporating a 1-day lag to capture short-term momentum, and adding a 7-day rolling mean to smooth out weekly trends and highlight underlying patterns.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/features-brent-oil.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> We can visualise some interesting relationships between gas energy generation across different temporal patterns in our dataset of June 2022 - June 2023 as follows: 
								</p>

								<span class="image"><img src="images/brent-1daylag.png" alt="" width="920" height="450"/></span>
								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Feature Importance</b></p>
								<p>	Features play a significant role in predicting or explaining the variations in gas power generation. In our data we can see the following features as the most important:
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/feature-importance-code.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/feature-importance.png" alt="" width="850" height="350"/></span>
                                <p> </p>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Day of Year: </b>The high feature importance of this variable suggests that the gas power generation shoots up significantly on certain days in the year. Since Gas power generation often plays a role in balancing the grid, this feature reflects issues like the fluctuating supply of renewables, weather conditions, gas pricing and maintenance scheduling.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Hour:</b> The feature importance of hour suggests that the gas power generation varies significantly throughout the day. In UK, on average, the highest gas power generation occurs in the evening between 6 to 8 PM while the lowest occurs early in the morning, around 4 am.</li>
									<li> <b>Day of the Week:</b> The feature importance of the day of week shows that power generation from gas is higher on weekdays than on weekends. For UK, on average more power is generated from gas on a Thursday on given week than any other day. While, power generated from gas on Sunday is significantly lower than any other day of the week.</li>
                                </ul>
								<h2>Running the regression using XGBoost</h2>
                                <p> For the task of time series forecasting of power generated by Gas for the period of 6th June 23' to 24th June 23' from the training dataset of hourly energy generated by gas from the period of 24th Jun 22' to 6th Jun 23', XGBoost is used with a learning rate of 0.05 (which was found to be the most optimal) and a maximum depth of 3.</p>

                                <p></p>
								<h2>Running the regression using LSTM</h2>
                                <p> For the task of time series forecasting of power generated by Gas for the period of 25th June 23' from the training dataset of hourly energy generated by gas from the period of 24th Jun 22' to 24th Jun 23', LSTM is used with number of inputs as 24, number of features as 1. We define a Sequential model with a 'relu' activation function and run it over 15 epochs (which was found to be the most optimal).</p>

                                <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Comparing the RMSEs, LSTM was a more accurate predictor for gas production for a one-day hourly period, but with this data for hourly frequency, it was unable to accurately predict a longer period of 2 weeks. (Neural networks are definitely a challenge for me, and I'm pretty sure there is some intricacy that I might've looked over).</li>
                                    <li>XGBoost had a higher RMSE, but did a better job at predicting a longer period of forecast.</li>
									<li>We understood that the three most important features affecting gas production are: 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Day of the yeek:</b> Since gas often plays a role in balancing the grid, this feature reflects issues like the fluctuating supply of renewables, weather conditions, gas pricing and maintenance scheduling.</li>
										    <li><b>Hour:</b> In the UK, on average, the highest gas power generation occurs in the evening between 6 to 8 PM while the lowest occurs early in the morning, around 4 am.</li>
										    <li><b>Day of week:</b> Power from gas generation is on average, higher on weekdays than on weekends with Thursday being the highest and Sunday being the lowest.</li>
										</ul>
