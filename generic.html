								<h2>Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)</h2>
								<p> To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL server and SSMS.

									One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.</p>
									
								<p>Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.</p>	
									
								<p>Date_DIM:</p>
								
								<span class="image"><img src="images/date_table.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p></p>
								<p>Customers_DIM:</p>
								
								<span class="image"><img src="images/Customers_table.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p></p>
								<p>Products_DIM:</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/Products_table.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p></p>
								<p>InternetSales_DIM:</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/internetsales_table.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p></p>
								<h2>Data Model</h2>
								<p>Below is the data model created after the cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.
								This data model also shows how the Budget table has been connected to InternetSales and other necessary DIM tables.</p>
